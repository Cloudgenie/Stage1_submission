                <p>Web pages are text documents created using a text editor using a special language called <a href="http://www.w3schools.com"><b>HTML</b></a>. <em>Browser</em> software on your PC is able to display these pages as intended by interpreting the words and codes within the text document after downloading them over the internet from a <em>server</em> where the pages are stored. There are a huge number of servers and web pages around the world and these together comprise the <em>"world wide web"</em>.</p>
                <p>Pages of HTML comprise two main sections, the <b>head</b> and the <b>body</b>. The head section contains <em>information</em> about the page such as its title and what <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference"><b>CSS</b></a> or <b>Javascript</b> is to be used, whereas the body section contains the <em>content</em> to be displayed.</p>
                <p>The HTML language comprises <b>elements</b> which contain <em>tags</em> with <em>attributes</em> and <em>text</em>.</p>
                <p>Some example tags are the anchor tag &lt;a&gt;, the div tag &lt;div&gt; and the bold tag &lt;b&gt;.</p>
                <p>Tags can be inline or block, inline are used just for text whereas block tags create an invisible box around the text which can be resized and have other properties assigned to it.</P>
                <p>Special text editing software exists that make writing HTML and other programming languages easier by pre-empting the words you are typing and displaying the code you have written in special colours and formatting that make it easier to read and understand. <em>Sublime Text</em> is a good example of such a text editor.</p>

                <p>The <em>structure</em> of an HTML webpage is stored in the <a href="http://www.w3.org/DOM/"><b>Document Object Model (DOM)</b></a> and is comprised of all the <em>elements</em> that exist in the HTML page. You can use the developer tools in a browser such as <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome/"><b>Google Chrome</b></a> to see the structure of a web page in action and make changes to see what each does. This can be a great way of learning. Also it can be very educational to actually draw the structure of a web page diagrammatically with a pencil and paper like in the example below.</P>

                <p>HTML controls the <em>structure</em> of a web page, but the <em>style</em> that you see is controlled by <b>CSS</b>. Applying a <em>'class'</em> to a div tag can be useful to give it a name or tell it what <em>style</em> to use.</p>
                <p>All web pages are comprised of a number of boxes, some of the boxes can be inside other boxes.</p>

                <p><b>CSS</b> determines the presentation of HTML documents and is used to change the appearance of the web page without the need to change the content or structure.</p>
                <p>One can define the content characteristics of parts of the web page either by HTML <em>element selectors</em> such as h1, p etc or by <em><b>class</b> selectors</em> that you can define yourself.</P>
                <p>CSS text should be placed in a separate file with a file extension of .css. In your HTML you tell the page what css file to use and where it is stored.</p>
                <p>Use of CSS and careful consideration to the structure of your HTML code leads to clean and easy to understand web pages and avoids the need to repeat unnecessary bits of  code.</p>
                <p>HTML and CSS can be checked by using online validation tools such as can be found here for <a href="http://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input">HTML</a> and here for <a href="http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input">CSS</a> at W3C.</p>
